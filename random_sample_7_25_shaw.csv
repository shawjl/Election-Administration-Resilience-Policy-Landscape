173 ""(b)  Upon the filing of such challenge, the board of registrars shall immediately consider 174 such challenge and determine whether probable cause exists to sustain such challenge.  If 175 the registrars do not find probable cause, the challenge shall be denied.  If the registrars 176 find probable cause, the registrars shall notify the poll officers of the challenged elector's 177 precinct or, if the challenged elector voted by absentee ballot, notify the poll officers at the 178 absentee ballot precinct and, if practical, notify the challenged elector and afford such 179 elector an opportunity to answer.  Probable causes shall include, but not be limited to, an 180 elector who is deceased; an elector voting or registering to vote in a different jurisdiction; 181 an elector obtaining a homestead exemption in a different jurisdiction; or an elector being 182 registered at a nonresidential address  as confirmed or listed by or in a government office, 183 data base, website, or publicly available sources derived solely from such governmental 184 sources.  If a challenged elector's name appears on the National Change of Address data 185 base, as maintained by the United States Postal Service, as having changed such elector's 186 residence to a different jurisdiction, the presence of such elector's name on such data base 187 shall be insufficient cause to sustain the challenge against the elector unless additional 188 evidence would indicate that the elector has lost his or her residency as determined 189 pursuant to Code Section 21-2-217; provided, however, that:
190 (1)  Any challenge of an elector within 45 days of a primary, run-off primary, election, 191 or run-off election shall be postponed until the certification of such primary, election, or 192 runoff is completed; and

The official tabulation count of any ballot scanner shall be based upon 229 the text portion or the machine mark, provided that such mark clearly denotes the elector's 230 selection and does not use a QR code, bar code, or similar coding, of such ballots and not
any machine coding that may be printed on such ballots.""
SECTION 8.
Said chapter is further amended in Code Section 21-2-386, relating to safekeeping, 234 certification, and validation of absentee ballots, rejection of ballot, delivery of ballots to 235 location designated by superintendent, duties of superintendent and managers, precinct 236 returns, report of returns of verified and accepted absentee ballots cast as soon as possible 237 following closing of polls, notification of challenged elector, and unlawful disclosure of 238 tabulation results, by revising paragraph (3) of subsection (a) as follows:

In the event that the only issue to be voted upon in an election is a 257 referendum question, the superintendent shall also notify in writing the chief judge of the 258 superior court of the county who shall appoint two electors of the county to monitor such
process.""
SECTION 9.
Said chapter is further amended by revising Code Section 21-2-386, relating to safekeeping, 262 certification, and validation of absentee ballots, rejection of ballot, delivery of ballots to 263 location designated by superintendent, duties of superintendent and managers, precinct 264 returns, report of returns of verified and accepted absentee ballots cast as soon as possible 265 following closing of polls, notification of challenged elector, and unlawful disclosure of 266 tabulation results, as follows:
""21-2-386.
(a)(1)(A)  The board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk shall keep safely, unopened, 269 and stored in a manner that will prevent tampering and unauthorized access to and shall 270 document authorized access to all official absentee ballots received from absentee 271 electors prior to the closing of the polls on the day of the primary or election except as 272 otherwise provided in this subsection.
273 (B)  Upon receipt of each ballot, a registrar or clerk shall write the day and hour of the 274 receipt of the ballot on its envelope.  The registrar or clerk shall then compare the 275 number of the elector's Georgia driver's license number or state identification card 276 issued pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 5 of Title 40 and date of birth entered on the 277 absentee ballot envelope with the same information contained in the elector's voter 278 registration records.  If the elector has affirmed on the envelope that he or she does not 279 have a Georgia driver's license or state identification card issued pursuant to Article 5 280 of Chapter 5 of Title 40, the registrar or clerk shall compare the last four digits of the 281 elector's social security number and date of birth entered on the envelope with the same 282 information contained in the elector's voter registration records.  The registrar or clerk 283 shall also confirm that the elector signed the oath and the person assisting the elector, 284 if any, signed the required oath.  If the elector has signed the elector's oath, the person 285 assisting has signed the required oath, if applicable, and the identifying information 286 entered on the absentee ballot envelope matches the same information contained in the 287 elector's voter registration record, the registrar or clerk shall so certify by signing or 288 initialing his or her name below the voter's oath.  Each elector's name so certified shall 289 be listed by the registrar or clerk on the numbered list of absentee voters prepared for 290 his or her precinct.  All accepted absentee ballots shall be securely stored in either a 291 sealed container or appropriately secured in an access controlled room that will prevent 292 tampering or unauthorized access prior to the scanning of such ballots.
293 (C)  If the elector has failed to sign the oath, or if the identifying information entered 294 on the absentee ballot envelope does not match the same information appearing in the 295 elector's voter registration record, or if the elector has failed to furnish required 296 information or information so furnished does not conform with that on file in the 297 registrar's or clerk's office, or if the elector is otherwise found disqualified to vote, the 298 registrar or clerk shall write across the face of the envelope 'Rejected,' giving the reason 299 therefor.  The board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk shall promptly notify the 300 elector of such rejection, a copy of which notification shall be retained in the files of 301 the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk for at least two years.  Such elector shall 302 have until the end of the period for verifying provisional ballots contained in 303 subsection (c) of Code Section 21-2-419 to cure the problem resulting in the rejection 304 of the ballot.  The elector may cure a failure to sign the oath, nonmatching identifying 305 information, or missing information by submitting an affidavit to the board of registrars 306 or absentee ballot clerk along with a copy of one of the forms of identification 307 enumerated in subsection (c) of Code Section 21-2-417 before the close of such period. 308 The affidavit shall affirm that the ballot was submitted by the elector, is the elector's 309 ballot, and that the elector is registered and qualified to vote in the primary, election, 310 or runoff in question.  If the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk finds the 311 affidavit and identification to be sufficient, the absentee ballot shall be counted.
312 (D)  An elector who registered to vote by mail, but did not comply with subsection (c) 313 of Code Section 21-2-220, and who votes for the first time in this state by absentee 314 ballot shall include with his or her application for an absentee ballot or in the outer oath 315 envelope of his or her absentee ballot either one of the forms of identification listed in 316 subsection (a) of Code Section 21-2-417 or a copy of a current utility bill, bank 317 statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the 318 name and address of such elector.  If such elector does not provide any of the forms of 319 identification listed in this subparagraph with his or her application for an absentee 320 ballot or with the absentee ballot, such absentee ballot shall be deemed to be a 321 provisional ballot and such ballot shall only be counted if the registrars are able to 322 verify current and valid identification of the elector as provided in this subparagraph 323 within the time period for verifying provisional ballots pursuant to Code 324 Section 21-2-419.  The board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk shall promptly notify 325 the elector that such ballot is deemed a provisional ballot and shall provide information 326 on the types of identification needed and how and when such identification is to be 327 submitted to the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk to verify the ballot.
(E)  Three copies of the numbered list of voters shall also be prepared for such rejected
absentee electors, giving the name of the elector and the reason for the rejection in each 330 case.  Three copies of the numbered list of certified absentee voters and three copies of 331 the numbered list of rejected absentee voters for each precinct shall be turned over to 332 the poll manager in charge of counting the absentee ballots and shall be distributed as 333 required by law for numbered lists of voters.
334 (F)  All absentee ballots returned to the board or absentee ballot clerk after the closing 335 of the polls on the day of the primary or election shall be safely kept unopened by the 336 board or absentee ballot clerk and then transferred to the appropriate clerk with the 337 documentation provided for in subparagraph (a)(1)(A) of this Code section for storage 338 in a manner that will prevent tampering for the period of time required for the 339 preservation of ballots used at the primary or election and shall then, without being 340 opened, be destroyed in like manner as the used ballots of the primary or election.  The 341 board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk shall promptly notify the elector by 342 first-class mail that the elector's ballot was returned too late to be counted and that the 343 elector will not receive credit for voting in the primary or election.  All such late 344 absentee ballots shall be delivered to the appropriate clerk and stored as provided in 345 Code Section 21-2-390.
(G)  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, until the United
States Department of Defense notifies the Secretary of State that the Department of 348 Defense has implemented a system of expedited absentee voting for those electors 349 covered by this subparagraph, absentee ballots cast in a primary, election, or runoff by 350 eligible absentee electors who reside outside the county or municipality in which the 351 primary, election, or runoff is held and are members of the armed forces of the United 352 States, members of the merchant marine of the United States, spouses or dependents of 353 members of the armed forces or merchant marine residing with or accompanying such 354 members, or overseas citizens that are postmarked by the date of such primary, election, 355 or runoff and are received within the three-day period following such primary, election, 356 or runoff, if proper in all other respects, shall be valid ballots and shall be counted and 357 included in the certified election results.
358 (2)(A)  Beginning at 8:00 A.M. on the third Monday prior to the day of the primary, 359 election, or runoff, the election superintendent shall be authorized to open the outer oath 360 envelope of absentee ballots that have been verified and accepted pursuant to 361 subparagraph (a)(1)(B) of this Code section, remove the contents of such outer 362 envelope, open the inner envelope marked 'Official Absentee Ballot,' and scan the 363 absentee ballot using one or more ballot scanners.  At least three persons who are 364 registrars, deputy registrars, poll workers, or absentee ballot clerks  shall be present 365 before commencing; and three persons who are registrars, deputy registrars, or absentee 366 ballot clerks shall be present at all times while the sealed containers containing verified 367 and accepted absentee ballots are unsealed and verified for integrity, while the absentee
ballot envelopes are  opened, and while the absentee ballots are  scanned. 
However, no person shall tally, tabulate, estimate, or attempt to tally, tabulate, or 370 estimate or cause the ballot scanner or any other equipment to produce any tally or 371 tabulate, partial or otherwise, of the absentee ballots cast until the time for the closing 372 of the polls on the day of the primary, election, or runoff except as provided in this 373 Code section.  Prior to beginning the process set forth in this paragraph, the 374 superintendent shall provide written notice to the Secretary of State in writing at least 375 seven days prior to processing and scanning absentee ballots.  Such notice shall contain
376 the dates, start and end times, and location or locations where absentee ballots will be 377 processed and scanned.  The superintendent shall also post such notice publicly in a 378 prominent location in the superintendent's office and on the home page of the county 379 election superintendent's website, if the county election superintendent maintains such 380 a website.  The Secretary of State shall publish on his or her website the information 381 he or she receives from superintendents stating the dates, times, and locations where 382 absentee ballots will be processed.
383 (B)  The proceedings set forth in this paragraph shall be open to the view of the public, 384 but no person except one employed and designated by the superintendent shall touch 385 any ballot or ballot container.  Any person involved in processing and scanning 386 absentee ballots shall swear an oath, in the same form as the oath for poll officers 387 provided in Code Section 21-2-95, prior to beginning the processing and scanning of 388 absentee ballots.  The county executive committee or, if there is no organized county 389 executive committee, the state executive committee of each political party and political 390 body having candidates whose names appear on the ballot for such election shall have 391 the right to designate two persons and each independent and nonpartisan candidate 392 whose name appears on the ballot for such election shall have the right to designate one 393 person to act as monitors for such process.  In the event that the only issue to be voted 394 upon in an election is a referendum question, the superintendent shall also notify in 395 writing the chief judge of the superior court of the county who shall appoint two 396 electors of the county to monitor such process.  While viewing or monitoring the 397 process set forth in this paragraph, monitors and observers shall be prohibited from:
398 (i)  In any way interfering with the processing or scanning of absentee ballots or the 399 conduct of the election;
(ii)  Using or bringing into the room any photographic or other electronic monitoring
or recording devices, cellular telephones, or computers;
(iii)  Engaging in any form of campaigning or campaign activity;

(v)  Touching any ballot or ballot container;
(vi)  Tallying, tabulating, estimating, or attempting to tally, tabulate, or estimate, 406 whether partial or otherwise, any of the votes on the absentee ballots cast; and
407 (vii)  Communicating any information that they see while monitoring the processing 408 and scanning of the absentee ballots, whether intentionally or inadvertently, about any 409 ballot, vote, or selection to anyone other than an election official who needs such 410 information to lawfully carry out his or her official duties.
411 (C)  The State Election Board shall promulgate rules requiring reconciliation 412 procedures; prompt and undelayed scanning of ballots after absentee ballot envelopes 413 are opened; secrecy of election results prior to the closing of the polls on the day of a 414 primary, election, or runoff; and other protections to protect the integrity of the process 415 set forth in this paragraph.
416 (D)  At the conclusion of the scanning of ballots, such scanned ballots shall be stored 417 in tamper-resistant containers sealed with numbered seals, the number of which shall 418 be recorded on the chain of custody document specified by the Secretary of State, and 419 such forms shall be signed by the person storing the ballots and the date and time of 420 storage shall be entered on such forms.
421 (3)  A county election superintendent may, in his or her discretion, after 7:00 A.M. on the 422 day of the primary, election, or runoff begin tabulating the absentee ballots; provided, 423 however, that all absentee ballots that have been verified and accepted pursuant to 424 subparagraph (a)(1)(B) of this Code section by the Monday prior to the day of the 425 primary, election, or runoff  shall be tabulated and the results reported by no later than 426 8:00 P.M. on the day of such primary, election, or runoff or within one hour of the 427 closing of all polls in such county, whichever occurs later.  If the county election 428 superintendent chooses to open the inner envelopes and begin tabulating such ballots 429 prior to the close of the polls on the day of the primary, election, or runoff, the 430 superintendent shall notify in writing, at least seven days prior to the primary, election, 431 or runoff, the Secretary of State of the superintendent's intent to begin the absentee ballot 432 tabulation prior to the close of the polls.  The county executive committee or, if there is 433 no organized county executive committee, the state executive committee of each political 434 party and political body having candidates whose names appear on the ballot for such 435 election in such county shall have the right to designate two persons and each 436 independent and nonpartisan candidate whose name appears on the ballot for such 437 election in such county shall have the right to designate one person to act as monitors for 438 such process.  In the event that the only issue to be voted upon in an election is a 439 referendum question, the superintendent shall also notify in writing the chief judge of the 440 superior court of the county who shall appoint two electors of the county to monitor such
process.
(4)  The county election superintendent shall publish a written notice in the 443 superintendent's office of the superintendent's intent to begin the absentee ballot 444 tabulation prior to the close of the polls and publish such notice at least one week prior 445 to the primary, election, or runoff in the legal organ of the county.
446 (5)  The process for opening absentee ballot envelopes, scanning absentee ballots, and 447 tabulating absentee ballots on the day of a primary, election, or runoff as provided in this 448 subsection shall be conducted in a manner to maintain the secrecy of all ballots and to 449 protect the disclosure of any balloting information before 7:00 P.M. on election day.  No 450 absentee ballots shall be tabulated before 7:00 A.M. on the day of a primary, election, or
runoff.

All such persons shall have no contact with the news media; shall have no contact 456 with other persons not involved in monitoring, observing, or conducting the tabulation; 457 shall not use any type of communication device including radios, telephones, and cellular 458 telephones; shall not utilize computers for the purpose of email, instant messaging, or 459 other forms of communication; and shall not communicate any information concerning 460 the tabulation until the time for the closing of the polls; provided, however, that 461 supervisory and technical assistance personnel shall be permitted to enter and leave the 462 area in which the tabulation is being conducted but shall not communicate any 463 information concerning the tabulation to anyone other than the county election 464 superintendent; the staff of the superintendent; those persons conducting, observing, or 465 monitoring the tabulation; and those persons whose technical assistance is needed for the 466 tabulation process to operate.
467 (7)  The absentee ballots shall be tabulated in accordance with the procedures of this 468 chapter for the tabulation of absentee ballots.  As such ballots are tabulated, they shall be 469 placed into locked ballot boxes and may be transferred to locked ballot bags, if needed, 470 for security.  Such boxes or bags shall be sealed and witnessed and verified by each 471 person taking custody of such items by each such person's signature and date and time 472 of taking custody.  The persons conducting the tabulation of the absentee ballots shall not 473 cause the tabulating equipment to produce any count, partial or otherwise, of the absentee 474 votes cast until the time for the closing of the polls except as otherwise provided in this
Code section.
(b)  When requested by the superintendent, but not earlier than the third Monday prior to 477 a primary, election, or runoff, a registrar or absentee ballot clerk shall deliver the official 478 absentee ballot of each certified absentee elector, each rejected absentee ballot, applications 479 for such ballots, and copies of the numbered lists of certified and rejected absentee electors 480 to the location designated by the superintendent in secure, sealed containers with the chain 481 of custody documents as specified by the Secretary of State and the signature and date and 482 time of the person taking custody, and the superintendent or official receiving such 483 absentee ballots shall issue his or her receipt therefor.
484 (c)  The superintendent shall cause the verified and accepted absentee ballots to be opened 485 and tabulated as provided in this Code section.  A manager shall then open the outer 486 envelope in such manner as not to destroy the oath printed thereon and shall deposit the 487 inner envelope marked 'Official Absentee Ballot' in a ballot box reserved for absentee 488 ballots with an accompanying chain of custody documentation.  Such ballot box shall be 489 securely sealed if it is not in the direct control of the poll officers or if it is transferred to 490 a different room or facility for tabulation.  In the event that an outer envelope is found to 491 contain an absentee ballot that is not in an inner envelope, the ballot shall be sealed in an
492 inner envelope, initialed and dated by the person sealing the inner envelope, and deposited 493 in the ballot box and counted in the same manner as other absentee ballots, provided that 494 such ballot is otherwise proper.  Such manager with two assistant managers, appointed by 495 the superintendent, with such clerks as the manager deems necessary shall count the 496 absentee ballots following the procedures prescribed by this chapter for other ballots, 497 insofar as practicable.
498 (d)  All absentee ballots shall be counted and tabulated in such a manner that returns may 499 be reported by precinct; and separate returns shall be made for each precinct in which 500 absentee ballots were cast showing the results by each precinct in which the electors reside. 501 The superintendent shall utilize the procedures set forth in this Code section to ensure that
502 the returns of verified and accepted absentee ballots cast are reported to the public as soon 503 as possible following the closing of the polls on the day of the primary, election, or runoff. 504 Failure to utilize these procedures to ensure that the returns of verified and accepted 505 absentee ballots are reported as soon as possible following the close of polls shall subject 506 the superintendent to sanctions by the State Election Board.  If a superintendent fails to 507 report the returns of verified and accepted absentee ballots by the day following the 508 election at 5:00 P.M., the State Election Board may convene an independent performance 509 review board pursuant to Code Section 21-2-107.
510 (e)  If an absentee elector's right to vote has been challenged for cause, a poll officer shall 511 write 'Challenged,' the elector's name, and the alleged cause of challenge on the outer 512 envelope and shall deposit the ballot in a secure, sealed ballot box for which there shall be 513 a chain of custody document as specified by the Secretary of State on which is recorded 514 and witnessed the name and signature of each person taking custody of such ballots; and 515 it shall be counted as other challenged ballots are counted.  Where direct recording 516 electronic voting systems are used for absentee balloting and a challenge to an elector's 517 right to vote is made prior to the time that the elector votes, the elector shall vote on a paper
518 or optical scanning ballot and such ballot shall be handled as provided in this subsection. 519 The board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk shall promptly notify the elector of such 520 challenge.
521 (f)  It shall be unlawful at any time prior to the close of the polls for any person to disclose 522 or for any person to receive any information regarding the results of the tabulation of
absentee ballots except as expressly provided by law.""
SECTION 10.
Said chapter is further amended in Code Section 21-2-493, relating to computation, 526 canvassing, and tabulation of returns, investigation of discrepancies in vote counts, recount 527 procedure, pilot program for posting of digital images of scanned paper ballots, certification 528 of returns, and change in returns, by revising subsection (a) and adding a new subsection to 529 read as follows:
530 ""(a)  The superintendent shall, after the close of the polls on the day of a primary or 531 election, at his or her office or at some other convenient public place at the county seat or 532 in the municipality, of which due notice shall have been given as provided by Code 533 Section 21-2-492, publicly commence the computation and canvassing of the returns and 534 continue until all absentee ballots received by the close of the polls, including those cast 535 by advance voting; provided, however, that such votes cast by advance voting shall be 536 tabulated and the results reported by no later than 8:00 P.M. on such day or within one hour 537 of the closing of all polls in such county, whichever occurs later, and all ballots cast on the 538 day of the primary or election have been counted and tabulated and the results of such 539 tabulation released to the public and, then, continuing with provisional ballots as provided
540 in Code Sections 21-2-418 and 21-2-419 and those absentee ballots as provided in 541 subparagraph (a)(1)(G) of Code Section 21-2-386 from day to day until completed.  For 542 this purpose, the superintendent may organize his or her assistants into sections, each of 543 whom may simultaneously proceed with the computation and canvassing of the returns 544 from various precincts of the county or municipality in the manner provided by this Code
545 section.  Upon the completion of such computation and canvassing, the superintendent 546 shall tabulate the figures for the entire county or municipality and sign, announce, and 547 attest the same, as required by this Code section.""
548 ""(j.2)(1)  On or after January 1, 2025, in the event that a superintendent receives a request 549 pursuant to Code Section 50-18-71 for scanned ballot images at a resolution higher than 550 the ballot images available from the Secretary of State pursuant to subsection (j.1) of this 551 Code section, and such request is received following the final certification of the results 552 of the election in which such ballots were created, the superintendent shall, consistent 553 with Code Section 50-18-71, produce digital scans of the requested ballots at a resolution 554 of no less than 600 dots per inch and deliver such scans to the requestor.  A person 555 making a request pursuant to this subsection may observe the scanning and related 556 handling process, but under no circumstances shall anyone other than an authorized 557 election official touch or handle a physical ballot.
558 (2)  Notwithstanding any seal provided for by Code Section 21-2-500, a superintendent 559 shall have access to the ballots cast within its jurisdiction so as to comply with the 560 provisions of this subsection.  Upon receiving a request pursuant to this subsection, the 561 superintendent shall notify the clerk of the superior court or, if designated by the clerk of 562 the superior court, the county records manager or other office or official under the 563 jurisdiction of a county governing authority which maintains or is responsible for 564 maintaining such sealed ballots, and such official or office that maintains such requested 565 ballot shall provide the superintendent access to such ballot without the need for 566 obtaining a court order.  All ballots provided to a superintendent pursuant to this 567 paragraph shall be immediately returned by such superintendent to the official or office
that maintains such ballots upon the scanning of such ballot.""
SECTION 11.
Said chapter is further amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
""21-2-498.1.
The Secretary of State shall create a pilot program for the auditing of paper ballot images
using optical character recognition technology or other related technology which shall 574 verify the human-readable text portion of the ballot.  Such auditing program shall not be 575 based on or tabulate any QR code, bar code, or similar machine coding that may be printed 576 on such ballots.  Such audits shall include all ballot types, and the audit findings shall be
reported prior to final certification of the election.""
SECTION 12.
Said chapter is further amended in Code Section 21-2-540, relating to conduct of special 580 primaries and special elections generally, by revising subsection (b) as follows:
581 ""(b)  At least 29 days shall intervene between the call of a special primary and the holding 582 of same, and at least 29 days shall intervene between the call of a special election and the 583 holding of same.  The period during which candidates may qualify to run in a special
primary or a special election shall remain open for a minimum of two and one-half days. 
Special  elections to present questions to the voters which are to be 586 held in conjunction with the presidential preference primary, a state-wide general primary, 587 or state-wide general election shall be called at least 90 days prior to the date of such 588 presidential preference primary, state-wide general primary, or state-wide general election; 589 provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to  special 590 elections to present questions to the voters held on the same date as such presidential 591 preference primary, state-wide general primary, or state-wide general election but 592 conducted completely separate and apart from such state-wide general primary or 593 state-wide general election using different ballots or voting equipment, facilities, poll
workers, and paperwork.""

 Sec. 3.  Section 16-621, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read: 
 START_STATUTE 16-621 .   Proceedings at the counting center 
 A.  All proceedings at the counting center shall be
under the direction of the board of supervisors or other officer in charge of
elections and shall be conducted in accordance with the approved instructions
and procedures manual provided for in section 16‑452 under the
observation of representatives of each political party and the public. The
proceedings at the counting center may also be observed by up to three
additional people representing a candidate for nonpartisan office, or
representing a political committee in support of or in opposition to a ballot
measure, proposition or question. A draw by lot shall determine which three
groups or candidates shall have representatives participate in the observation
at the counting center. Persons representing a candidate for nonpartisan
office or persons or groups representing a political committee in support of or
in opposition to a ballot measure, proposition or question, who are interested
in participating in the observation, shall notify the officer in charge of
elections of their desire to be included in the draw    not  later than    seventeen
 days before the election. After the deadline to receive submissions
from the interested persons or groups, but prior to    fourteen  days before the election, the county officer in charge
of elections shall draw by lot, from the list of those   that  expressed interest, three persons or groups and those
selected shall be notified and allowed to observe the proceedings at the
counting center. If a group is selected   the group  may alter who represents that group for different
days of observation but on any given observation day a selected group shall not
send more than one observer. A group may rotate an observer throughout the
day. No persons except those authorized for the purpose shall touch any ballot
or ballot card or return. All persons who are engaged in processing and
counting of the ballots shall be qualified electors, shall be deputized in
writing and shall take an oath that they will faithfully perform their assigned
duties.  There shall be no preferential counting of ballots for the
purpose of projecting the outcome of the election. If any ballot, including
any ballot received from early voting, is damaged or defective so that it
cannot properly be counted by the automatic tabulating equipment, a true
duplicate copy shall be made of the damaged ballot in the presence of witnesses
and substituted for the damaged ballot. All duplicate ballots shall be clearly
labeled ""duplicate"" and shall bear a serial number   that  shall be recorded on the damaged or defective ballot. 
 B.  If for any reason it becomes impracticable to
count all or a part of the ballots with tabulating equipment, the officer in
charge of elections may direct that they be counted manually, following as far
as practicable the provisions governing the counting of paper ballots. 
 C.  For any statewide, county or legislative
election, the county recorder or officer in charge of elections shall provide
for a live video recording of the custody of all ballots while the ballots are
present in a tabulation room in the counting center. The live video recording
shall include date and time indicators and shall be linked to the secretary of
state's website. The secretary of state shall post links to the video coverage
for viewing by the public. The county recorder or officer in charge of elections
shall record the video coverage of the ballots at the counting center and shall
retain those recordings as a public record for at least as long as the
challenge period for the general election. If the live video feed is disrupted
or disabled, the recorder or officer in charge of elections is not liable for
the disruption but shall attempt to reinstate video coverage as soon as is
practicable. Any disruption in video coverage shall not affect or prevent the
continued tabulation of ballots. This subsection is contingent on legislative
appropriation. 
 D.  The county recorder or other officer in charge of
elections shall maintain records that record the chain of custody for all
election equipment and ballots during early voting through the completion of provisional
voting tabulation.  END_STATUTE

(2) The secretary of state may conduct tests of a voting system in order to select the uniform voting system. The secretary of state shall not consider a voting system for selection as the uniform voting system unless the voting system is approved and certified as provided in section 795a. At the secretary of state’s request, the board of state canvassers shall perform the approval and certification review, as provided in section 795a, of a voting system that the secretary of state wants to consider for selection as the uniform voting system.

The secretary of state shall widely publicize the schedule and changes to the schedule. If, however, a jurisdiction has acquired a new voting system within 8 years before the jurisdiction receives notice from the secretary of state under subsection (3), that jurisdiction is not required to acquire and use the uniform voting system until the expiration of 10 years after the date of the original purchase of the equipment. (5) If, after selection of the uniform voting system, the secretary of state determines that the uniform voting system no longer serves the welfare of the voters or has become out of date in regards to voting system technology, the secretary of state may repeat the process for selecting the uniform voting system authorized under this section. (6) This section does not apply until money is appropriated for the purpose of selecting, acquiring, and implementing the uniform voting system. If federal money becomes available for the purposes described in this section, the secretary of state shall, and the legislature intends to, take the steps necessary to qualify for and appropriate that money for the purposes described in this section.

The office designation provided by the secretary of state must be included in the heading of all nominating petitions. Nominating petitions containing an improper office designation are invalid. (5) The secretary of state shall issue an office designation of incumbent position for any judgeship for which the incumbent judge is eligible to seek reelection. If an incumbent judge does not file an affidavit of candidacy by the deadline, the secretary of state shall notify all candidates for that office that a nonincumbent position exists. All nominating petitions circulated for the nonincumbent position after the deadline must bear an office designation of nonincumbent position. All signatures collected before the affidavit of candidacy filing deadline may be filed with the nonincumbent nominating petitions. (6) If a candidate for nomination for the office of judge of the district court receives incorrect or inaccurate written information from the secretary of state or the bureau of elections concerning the number of nominating petition signatures required under section 544f and that incorrect or inaccurate written information is published or distributed by the secretary of state or the bureau of elections, the candidate may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable relief.

(7) If a court grants equitable relief to a candidate under subsection (6), the candidate must be given the opportunity to obtain additional nominating petition signatures to meet the requirements under section 544f. The additional nominating petition signatures obtained by a candidate must be filed with the secretary of state no later than 4 p.m. on the fifth business day after the date that the court order granting equitable relief is filed. (8) The nominating petition signatures filed under this section are subject to challenge as provided in section 552. Sec. 467c. (1) An incumbent district court judge may become a candidate in the primary election for the office of which he or she is an incumbent by filing with the secretary of state an affidavit of candidacy in lieu of nominating petitions not less than 134 days before the date of the primary election. However, if an incumbent district court judge was appointed to fill a vacancy and the judge entered upon the duties of the office less than 137 days before the date of the primary election but before the fifteenth Tuesday before the primary election, the incumbent judge may file the affidavit of candidacy not more than 3 days after entering upon the duties of office.

(b) The names of candidates for an existing judgeship or judgeships for which the incumbent is not seeking election. (c) The names of candidates for a newly created judgeship or judgeships. (4) If the death or disqualification of an incumbent judge triggers the application of section 467e(2), then for the purposes of subsection (3) and section 467b(2), that judgeship must be regarded as a judgeship for which the incumbent judge is not seeking election. The application of this subsection includes, but is not limited to, circumstances in which the governor appoints an individual to fill the vacancy and that individual seeks to qualify as a nominee under section 467e(2).

A complaint received by the county clerk after the ballots have been released for printing and before the primary election must not be acted upon. Sec. 624a. (1) A precinct delegate may resign his or her office upon written notice to the chairperson of the county committee and the county clerk of the county or district in which the delegate resides.

(3) The county chair of a major political party may challenge the appointment of an election inspector based upon the qualifications of the election inspector, the legitimacy of the election inspector’s political party affiliation, or whether there is a properly completed declaration of political party affiliation in the application for that election inspector on file in the clerk’s office. The challenge must be in writing, specifically identify the reason for the challenge, and include any available documentation supporting the challenge. The county chair of the political party shall file a challenge under this subsection with the board of election commissioners not later than 4 business days following receipt of the board of election commissioners’ notice of appointed election inspectors under subsection (2).

Sec. 679. (1) The legislative body of a city or township, by resolution, may provide that for an election in a precinct of the city or township, there shall be an additional board of election inspectors, known as the counting board. The counting board must consist of 3 or more election inspectors. Sections 673a and 674 apply to the appointment of election inspectors to counting boards under this section. The counting board shall count the ballots cast in the precinct at an election and make a statement of returns of that count. The provisions of this chapter relative to the appointment, qualifications, privileges, powers, duties, and oaths of office of election inspectors apply to the members of a counting board, to the extent that they apply to the counting of the votes cast at and the making of the statement of returns of an election.

(3) Section 662 applies to the designation and prescribing of the place or places in which the counting board performs its duties under this section. Sec. 679a. (1) The election commission of a city or township shall, by resolution, provide that at an election at which the ballots are counted and certified at the precinct, 1 or more additional boards of election inspectors be appointed to serve as receiving boards. For a precinct having receiving boards, the board of election commissioners shall appoint a receiving board consisting of 2 or more election inspectors, with an equal number from each major political party, and shall appoint an equal number of election inspectors from each major political party. (2) Not less than 2 election inspectors in a precinct, representing each of the major political parties, shall deliver to the receiving board for that precinct a sealed ballot container containing the voted ballots, and, in a separate sealed envelope, the poll book and statement of returns. The poll book and statement of returns may be enclosed in a single sealed envelope. (3) The receiving board shall open the sealed envelope and review the poll book and statement of returns to determine both of the following: (a) That the ballot container is properly sealed and the seal number is properly recorded in the poll book and the statement of returns. If the ballot container is not properly sealed or there is a discrepancy with the seal number recorded in the poll book or the statement of returns, the election inspectors who delivered the ballot container and the receiving board shall together take the necessary steps to correct the discrepancy. The election inspectors and the receiving board shall note the discrepancy and the corrective action in the remarks section of the poll book and all shall sign the notation. (b) That the number of individuals voting recorded in the poll book equals the number of ballots issued to electors, as shown by the statement of returns. If the number of individuals voting as shown by the poll book does not equal the number of ballots counted as shown by the statement of returns, and if an explanation of the discrepancy has not been noted in the poll book, the receiving board shall ask the election inspectors about the discrepancy, note the explanation in the poll book, and all shall sign the notation. (4) If the poll book or statement of returns has been erroneously sealed in the ballot container, the election inspectors may open the ballot container and remove the poll book or statement of returns. The elections inspectors and receiving board shall note the corrective action in the remarks section of the poll book and all shall sign the notation before placing the poll book or statement of returns in a separate sealed envelope. If the statement of returns was sealed in the ballot container and the poll book was sealed in an envelope, the poll book must be removed from the sealed envelope for the notation of corrective action to be recorded before placing the poll book and statement of returns in a sealed envelope. The receiving board shall notify the clerk of the board of canvassers responsible for canvassing all or a portion of the election of the corrective action taken. (5) When the receiving board has completed the review under subsection (3), the receiving board shall place the poll book and statement of returns in the appropriate envelope, sealed with a red paper seal and initialed by the receiving board. If permitted by the clerk of the board of canvassers, the poll books and statement of returns from more than 1 precinct may be included and delivered in a single envelope. Sec. 682. Any person employed as an inspector of election, or in any other official capacity at any election, primary election, or on any board of canvassers or board of registration, shall, except as otherwise specifically provided, receive reasonable compensation as allowed by the township board of any township, board of commissioners of any county, or the legislative body of any city, as applicable. Sec. 683. Each county clerk before each primary and election shall, by some reliable means, notify the clerk of each township and city in the county of a training school for election inspectors to be held at a place designated by the county clerk within 20 days before each primary, general, and special election. The township and city clerks shall notify each election inspector appointed to serve at that election of the time and place of the training school. At the meeting, the county clerk shall instruct and demonstrate the manner in which the duties of election inspectors are required by law to be performed. It is the duty of the inspectors, so notified, to attend the meeting unless excused by the county clerk for good cause. Compensation may be paid to them by their respective municipalities at a rate as determined by the governing bodies. An election inspector shall not serve in any election unless he or she has within the last preceding 2 years either attended an election school or has passed satisfactorily an examination given by the election commission of the city or township in which appointed. The examination is subject to the approval of the secretary of state. This section does not prevent the appointment of an election inspector to fill a vacancy. This section does not prohibit any city or any township having a population of 10,000 or more from conducting its own training school for election inspectors of that city or township. If a city or township conducts its own training school, election inspectors who attend a city or township training school are not required to attend the county training school. Sec. 690. The township or city board of election commissioners for each jurisdiction conducting the election shall have the ballots required for a regular or special township, village, city, school, or community college election, or official primary election for the nomination of candidates for township, city, ward, or community college offices, to be printed and delivered to the election commission’s township or city clerk at least 45 days before the election. The duties imposed upon county boards of election commissioners and upon county, township, and city clerks relative to the printing, counting, packaging, sealing, and delivery of official ballots are imposed upon the township and municipal boards of election commissioners and the township or city clerks relative to the printing, counting, packaging, sealing, and delivery of official ballots for use in each precinct of the township or city at a municipal, township, village, school, or community college election.

Sec. 762. If from any precinct the township or city clerk does not receive any application for absent voter ballots, the clerk shall deliver the packages of absent voter ballots intact to the chairperson or some member of the board of election inspectors of the precinct before the opening of the polls on election day.

authority from which that member is elected. The boundaries
and the number of electoral districts shall be established by
the initial board within two years of the creation of the
authority. The board may in its governance document provide
for redistricting upon any change in the authority's boundary
and following each decennial census. The elected board of
directors shall serve staggered terms to be established in
the governance document developed by the board.
M. All elections of the authority shall be
conducted pursuant to the provisions of the Local Election
Act and voted upon by the qualified electors registered to
vote within the boundaries of the authority. Board members
shall be elected at the regular local election. Vacancies on
the board shall be filled by the remaining board members and
a person appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve until the
next regular local election. A person appointed to fill a














































HB 407/a







1051560365759vacancy shall be a qualified elector of the districted area
the person is appointed to represent.
N. If the authority places a lien on property for
nonpayment of money owed, the authority shall file in the
office of the county clerk of the county or counties in which
the property is located a notice of lien, which shall
include:
(1) identification of the outstanding debt
to the authority;
(2) the fact that a lien is established;
(3) the general purpose of the lien;
(4) the name of the owner of the property
against which the lien is established as determined from the
records of the county assessor;
(5) a description of the property against
which the lien is established;
(6) the amount of the lien; and
(7) if the lien is for more than one period
of time, the date for which the lien is established.
O. A lien for multiple charges or assessments on a
property owner may be included in the same notice of lien,
and it shall not be necessary to file separate liens against
the separate properties. The lien shall be attested in the
name of the authority. The principal amount of any lien
imposed for a charge or assessment shall bear interest at the














































HB 407/a







1051560365759rate of twelve percent per year from the date of filing the
notice of lien unless otherwise provided by law.
P. After the filing of the notice of lien in the
office of the county clerk, the authority shall have a lien
upon the property described in the notice of lien. The
filing of the notice of lien shall be notice to all the world
of the existence of the lien and of the contents of the
notice of lien. No such lien shall affect the title or
rights to or in any real estate, of any purchaser, mortgagee
in good faith or judgment lien creditor, without knowledge of
the existence of such lien, unless the notice of lien is
filed in accordance with this section in the office of the
county clerk of the county in which the real estate is
situated. All authority liens shall be first and prior liens
on the property subject only to the lien of federal, state
and county taxes. The authority may release a lien against
any specific property by:
(1) entering and signing a receipt of
payment upon the notice of lien filed in the office of the
county clerk; or
(2) issuing a separate receipt that recites
that payment of the lien with any accrued interest and
penalty has been made.
Q. The authority may, in a single suit, foreclose
the liens against all persons named in the notice of liens or














































HB 407/a







1051560365759against the property if the owners are unknown. The
complaint filed shall:
(1) expressly name each defendant, if known;
(2) describe the property against which the
lien is established; and
(3) set forth the amount of the lien.
R. The judgment or decree rendered in said cause
shall be several against the named defendants and against the
several properties for the amounts decreed to be due by each.
A lien against real estate may be foreclosed in the same
manner that mortgages or other liens against real estate are
foreclosed with like rights of redemption. In the
foreclosure of any lien created by the authority, reasonable
attorney fees may be ordered by the court as part of the
costs in favor of the prevailing party.
S. The authority shall prepare and sign a notice
of foreclosure, which shall also bear the signature and
mailing address of an attorney representing the authority.
The proceeds of the sale of the property by the authority
pursuant to a foreclosure sale on a lien shall be applied as
follows:
(1) first, to the payment of costs in giving
notice of the sale and of conducting the sale;
(2) second, to the indebtedness claimed
under a lien on the property for federal, state, county,














































HB 407/a







1051560365759municipal or ad valorem taxes;
(3) third, to the indebtedness claimed under
the lien of the authority;
(4) fourth, to all other special assessments
having a lien on the property; and
(5) fifth, after all such costs, liens,
assessments and taxes are paid, to the former owner, mortgage
holder or parties having an interest in the tract or parcel,
upon such persons providing satisfactory proof to the court
of such interest and upon approval of the court.

 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona: 
 Section 1. Section 9-235, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read: 
 START_STATUTE 9-235.   Vacancies in council 
 A. The council shall fill a vacancy that may occur
by appointment until the next regularly scheduled council election if the
vacancy occurs more than thirty days before the nomination petition deadline,
otherwise the appointment is for the unexpired term.  If
the city or town by ordinance provides that at the primary election any
candidate for the office of mayor or city council who receives a majority of
all votes cast at that election for that office is declared elected to the
office and a candidate to fill the vacancy in that office receives a majority
of all votes cast for that office at the primary election, section 9-821.01,
subsection D applies.  This subsection does not apply to a
charter city. 
 B. The member appointed shall meet the
qualifications established in section 9-232.  END_STATUTE 
 Sec. 2. Section 9-821.01, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read: 
 START_STATUTE 9-821.01.   Declaration of statewide concern; nonpartisan city and town
elections; districts; procedure 
 A. Arizona courts have recognized that the
Constitution of Arizona requires the legislature's involvement in issues
relating to elections conducted by charter cities, including initiative and
referendum elections, the method of elections other than by ballot, laws
relating to primary elections, voter registration laws to prevent abuse and
fraud and campaign finance laws. The legislature finds that the
conduct of elections described in this section is a matter of statewide
concern. 
 B. Notwithstanding any other law, a city or town
shall not hold any election on candidates for which there is any indication on
the ballot of the source of the candidacy or of the support of the candidate. 
 C. Notwithstanding any other law, for any city or
town that provides for election of city or town council members by district,
ward, precinct or other geographical designation, only those voters who are
qualified electors of the district, ward, precinct or other geographic
designation are eligible to vote for that council member candidate in the city
or town's primary, general, runoff or other election. 
 D. Notwithstanding any other law or any charter
provision, a city or town may by ordinance provide that at the primary election
any candidate for the office of mayor or city council who receives a majority
of all votes cast at that election for that office   shall be  declared elected to the office for which the person
is a candidate, effective as of the date of the general election, and a further
election may not be held as to such candidate ,   except that if the person holding the
office of mayor or city council at the time of the primary election is holding
that office by appointment as prescribed by section 9-235, the following
apply: 
 1. A candidate for the remainder of
that term in office who receives a majority of all votes cast at the primary
election both:  
 ( a ) Shall be
declared elected after the canvass and certification of the results of that
primary election and on taking the oath of office.  
 ( b ) Shall be
seated in accordance with subsection e of this section. 
 2. A candidate for a new term in that
office who receives a majority of all votes cast at the primary election both:  
 ( a ) shall be
declared elected to the new term of office, effective after the canvass and
certification of the results of that primary election and on taking the oath of
office.  
 ( b ) may be
seated to complete the remainder of existing term in accordance with subsection
E of this section. 
 E. If more than one candidate
receives a majority of all votes cast at the primary for an office that is
currently being served by a person who is appointed as provided in subsection d
of this section, the order of seating the candidates shall be determined by the
highest number of votes. 
 F.  For the purposes of   subsection  D of this section , the
majority of votes cast is determined by: 
 1. Calculating the total number of actual votes cast
for all candidates for an office whose names were lawfully on the ballot for
that office. 
 2. Dividing the sum reached pursuant to paragraph 1
of this subsection by the number of seats to be filled for the office. 
 3. Dividing the number reached pursuant to paragraph
2 of this subsection by two and rounding that number to the highest whole
number.  
   G.  If
more candidates receive a majority of votes cast than there are seats to be
filled for the office pursuant to subsection D of this section, from among
those candidates who receive a majority of votes cast, the candidates who
receive the highest number of votes equal to the number of seats to be filled
for the office   shall be  declared
elected to that office. 
   H.  If
at the primary election no candidate receives the majority of the votes cast or
the number of seats to be filled for the office is more than the number of
candidates who receive a majority of votes cast, of the candidates who did not
receive a majority of votes cast, the number of candidates who advance to the
general or runoff election   shall be 
equal in number to twice the number of seats to be filled for the office and
the candidates who received the highest number of votes for the office   shall be  the only candidates at the
general or runoff election. If more than one candidate received an
equal number of votes and that number was the highest number of votes for the
office, then all candidates receiving the equal number of votes   shall be  candidates at the general or runoff election. The
candidates equal in number to the seats to be filled for the office who receive
the highest number of votes at the general or runoff election   shall be  declared elected to that office. If two or more
candidates receive an equal number of votes cast for the same office, and a
higher number than any other candidate, the candidate who shall be declared
elected   shall be  determined by
lot in the presence of the candidates. A write-in candidate may not advance to
the general or runoff election if the write-in candidate did not receive a
number of votes equivalent to at least the same number of signatures required
by section 16-322 for nominating petitions for the same office.  
   I.  In
addition to subsection D of this section, any town with a population of five
thousand persons or less may by majority vote of the qualified electors of the
town voting on the question provide that at the primary election those
candidates receiving the highest number of votes for the offices to be filled   shall be  declared elected to the
office, and a further election may not be held if at least three-fifths
of the seats are filled by persons receiving a majority of the votes cast as
provided in subsection D of this section.  END_STATUTE

 Section 1. Section 9-235, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read: 
 START_STATUTE 9-235.   Vacancies in council 
 A. The council shall fill a vacancy that may occur
by appointment until the next regularly scheduled council election if the

candidate for the office of mayor or city council who receives a majority of
all votes cast at that election for that office is declared elected to the
office and a candidate to fill the vacancy in that office receives a majority
of all votes cast for that office at the primary election, section 9-821.01,
subsection D applies.  This subsection does not apply to a
charter city. 
 B. The member appointed shall meet the
qualifications established in section 9-232.  END_STATUTE 
 Sec. 2. Section 9-821.01, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read: 
 START_STATUTE 9-821.01.   Declaration of statewide concern; nonpartisan city and town
elections; districts; procedure 
 A. Arizona courts have recognized that the
Constitution of Arizona requires the legislature's involvement in issues
relating to elections conducted by charter cities, including initiative and
referendum elections, the method of elections other than by ballot, laws
relating to primary elections, voter registration laws to prevent abuse and
fraud and campaign finance laws. The legislature finds that the
conduct of elections described in this section is a matter of statewide
concern. 
 B. Notwithstanding any other law, a city or town
shall not hold any election on candidates for which there is any indication on
the ballot of the source of the candidacy or of the support of the candidate. 
 C. Notwithstanding any other law, for any city or
town that provides for election of city or town council members by district,
ward, precinct or other geographical designation, only those voters who are
qualified electors of the district, ward, precinct or other geographic
designation are eligible to vote for that council member candidate in the city
or town's primary, general, runoff or other election. 
 D. Notwithstanding any other law or any charter
provision, a city or town may by ordinance provide that at the primary election
any candidate for the office of mayor or city council who receives a majority
of all votes cast at that election for that office  is  shall be  declared elected to the office for which the person
is a candidate, effective as of the date of the general election, and a further
election may not be held as to such candidate ,  .   except that if the person holding the
office of mayor or city council at the time of the primary election is holding
that office by appointment as prescribed by section 9-235, the following
apply: 
 1. A candidate to fill the vacancy
who receives a majority of all votes cast at that primary election for that
office shall be declared elected to that office, effective after the canvass
and certification of the results of that primary election and on taking the
oath of office. 
 2. The appointed member's term of
office ends when the elected candidate takes the oath of office. 
 E.  For the purposes of  this  subsection  D of this section , the
majority of votes cast is determined by: 
 1. Calculating the total number of actual votes cast
for all candidates for an office whose names were lawfully on the ballot for
that office. 
 2. Dividing the sum reached pursuant to paragraph 1
of this subsection by the number of seats to be filled for the office. 
 3. Dividing the number reached pursuant to paragraph
2 of this subsection by two and rounding that number to the highest whole
number.  
 E.   F.  If
more candidates receive a majority of votes cast than there are seats to be
filled for the office pursuant to subsection D of this section, from among
those candidates who receive a majority of votes cast, the candidates who
receive the highest number of votes equal to the number of seats to be filled
for the office  is  shall be  declared
elected to that office. 
 F.   G.  If
at the primary election no candidate receives the majority of the votes cast or
the number of seats to be filled for the office is more than the number of
candidates who receive a majority of votes cast, of the candidates who did not
receive a majority of votes cast, the number of candidates who advance to the
general or runoff election  is  shall be 
equal in number to twice the number of seats to be filled for the office and
the candidates who received the highest number of votes for the office  are  shall be  the only candidates at the
general or runoff election. If more than one candidate received an
equal number of votes and that number was the highest number of votes for the
office, then all candidates receiving the equal number of votes  are  shall be  candidates at the general or runoff election. The
candidates equal in number to the seats to be filled for the office who receive
the highest number of votes at the general or runoff election  is  shall be  declared elected to that office. If two or more
candidates receive an equal number of votes cast for the same office, and a
higher number than any other candidate, the candidate who shall be declared
elected  is  shall be  determined by
lot in the presence of the candidates. A write-in candidate may not advance to
the general or runoff election if the write-in candidate did not receive a
number of votes equivalent to at least the same number of signatures required
by section 16-322 for nominating petitions for the same office.  
 G.   H.  In addition to subsection D   of this section, any town
with a population of five thousand persons or less may by majority vote of the
qualified electors of the town voting on the question provide that at the
primary election those candidates receiving the highest number of votes for the
offices to be filled  are  shall be 
declared elected to the office, and a further election may not be held if at
least three-fifths of the seats are filled by persons receiving a
majority of the votes cast as provided in subsection D of this section.  END_STATUTE","is .  this E. is F. is are are is is G. are",0,1,"other",NA,NA

    14  board  of elections shall not be required to send such communications to
    15  voters in inactive status. The communication shall notify the  voter   in 
    16   bold print contained in such notice  of the days and hours of the ensuing

     7  voter's election  district  has  been  moved,  the  communication  shall
     8  contain  the following legend in bold type: ""YOUR POLLING PLACE HAS BEEN
     9  CHANGED. YOU NOW VOTE AT.........."". The communication shall also  indi-

        Introduced  by M. of A. PERRY -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. ORTIZ --
          read once and referred to the Committee on Election Law
        AN ACT to amend the election law, in relation to the notice of the  days
          and hours for voting in primary and general elections
           The  People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assem- 
         bly, do enact as follows: 
     1    Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 4-117  of  the  election  law,  as
     2  amended by chapter 3 of the laws of 2018, is amended to read as follows:
     3    1.  The  board  of elections, between August first and August fifth of
     4  each year, shall send by mail on which is endorsed such language  desig-
     5  nated  by  the  state board of elections to ensure postal authorities do
     6  not forward such mail but return it  to  the  board  of  elections  with
     7  forwarding  information,  when  it  cannot be delivered as addressed and
     8  which contains a request that any such mail  received  for  persons  not
     9  residing at the address be dropped back in the mail, a communication, in
    10  a  form  approved  by  the state board of elections, to every registered
    11  voter who has been registered without a  change  of  address  since  the
    12  beginning  of such year, except that the board of elections shall not be
    13  required to send such communications to voters in inactive  status.  The
    14  communication  shall  notify the voter  in bold print of at least sixteen 
    15   point font contained in such notice  of the days and hours of the ensuing
    16  primary and general elections, the place where he appears by his  regis-
    17  tration records to be entitled to vote,  and also in other than bold type 
    18   of   the  fact  that  voters  who  have moved or will have moved from the
    19  address where they were last registered must  re-register  or,  that  if
    20  such  move  was to another address in the same county or city, that such
    21  voter may either notify the board of elections of  his  new  address  or
    22  vote  by  paper  ballot at the polling place for his new address even if
    23  such voter has not re-registered, or otherwise  notified  the  board  of
    24  elections  of  the change of address. If the primary will not be held on
    25  the first Tuesday after the second Monday  in  September,  the  communi-
         EXPLANATION--Matter in  italics  (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
                              [   ] is old law to be omitted.
                                                                   LBD06676-01-9
 
        A. 1385                             2
     1  cation  shall  contain  a  conspicuous notice in all capital letters and
     2  bold font notifying the voter of the primary date. If  the  location  of
     3  the  polling place for the voter's election district has been moved, the
     4  communication  shall  contain  the  following legend in bold type: ""YOUR
     5  POLLING PLACE HAS BEEN CHANGED. YOU NOW VOTE AT.........."". The communi-
     6  cation shall also indicate whether the polling place  is  accessible  to
     7  physically  disabled voters, that a voter who will be out of the city or
     8  county on the day of the primary or general election or a voter  who  is
     9  ill  or  physically disabled may obtain an absentee ballot, that a phys-
    10  ically disabled voter whose polling place is not accessible may  request
    11  that  his registration record be moved to an election district which has
    12  a polling place which is accessible, the phone number to call for appli-
    13  cations to move a registration record or for  absentee  ballot  applica-
    14  tions,  the  phone  number  to call for the location of registration and
    15  polling places, the phone number to call to indicate that the  voter  is
    16  willing  to  serve on election day as an election inspector, poll clerk,
    17  interpreter or in other capacities, the phone number to call  to  obtain
    18  an  application  for  registration  by  mail, and such other information
    19  concerning the elections or registration as the board  may  include.  In
    20  lieu  of sending such communication to every registered voter, the board
    21  of elections may send a single communication to a  household  containing
    22  more  than  one  registered  voter,  provided that the names of all such
    23  voters appear as part of the address on such communication.

The People of the State of Michigan enact: Sec. 2. As used in this act: (a) “Absent voter” is defined in section 758. (b) “Ballot container” is defined in section 14a. (c) “Business day” or “secular day” means a day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. (d) “Clearly observable boundaries” is defined in section 654a. (e) “Election” means an election or primary election at which the electors of this state or of a subdivision of this state choose or nominate by ballot an individual for public office or decide a ballot question lawfully submitted to them. (f) “Election precinct” is defined in section 654. (g) “Fall” state and county conventions and “spring” state and county conventions are assigned meanings in section 596. (h) “General election” or “general November election” means the election held on the November regular election date in an even numbered year. (i) “Identification for election purposes” means, if issued to the individual presenting the card or document and if presented for voting purposes the name on the card or document sufficiently matches the individual’s name in his or her voter registration record so as to accurately identify the individual as the registered elector, or if issued to the individual presenting the card or document and if presented for voter registration purposes, any of the following: ( i ) An operator’s or chauffeur’s license issued under the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, or an enhanced driver license issued under the enhanced driver license and enhanced official state personal identification card act, 2008 PA 23, MCL 28.301 to 28.308. ( ii ) An official state personal identification card issued under 1972 PA 222, MCL 28.291 to 28.300, or an enhanced official state personal identification card issued under the enhanced driver license and enhanced official state personal identification card act, 2008 PA 23, MCL 28.301 to 28.308. ( iii ) A current operator’s or chauffeur’s license issued by another state. ( iv ) A current state personal identification card issued by another state.

(j) “Immediate family” means an individual’s father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, and spouse and a relative of any degree residing in the same household as that individual. Sec. 497c. (1) Subject to subsection (2), a person who applies in person to register to vote at a department of state office, a designated voter registration agency, the office of a county clerk, or the office of the clerk of the city or township in which the applicant resides shall identify himself or herself by presenting identification for election purposes. (2) If a person who applies in person to register to vote as provided in subsection (1) does not possess identification for election purposes, the person may sign an affidavit to that effect and be allowed to register to vote. However, the person remains subject to any applicable federal identification requirements under the help America vote act of 2002 until those identification requirements are satisfied. Sec. 523. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), at each election, before being given a ballot, each registered elector offering to vote must identify himself or herself by presenting identification for election purposes, and by executing an application, on a form prescribed by the secretary of state, in the presence of an election official that includes all of the following: (a) The name of the elector. (b) The elector’s address of residence. (c) The elector’s date of birth. (d) An affirmative statement by the elector that is included in the signature statement indicating that he or she is a citizen of the United States. (e) The elector’s signature or mark. (2) If an elector’s signature contained in the qualified voter file is available in the polling place, the election official shall compare the signature upon the application with the digitized signature provided by the qualified voter file. If an elector’s signature is not contained in the qualified voter file, the election official shall process the application in the same manner as applications are processed when a voter registration list is used in the polling place. If voter registration lists are used in the precinct, the election inspector shall determine if the name on the application to vote appears on the voter registration list. If the name appears on the voter registration list, the elector shall provide further identification or other information stated upon the voter registration list. If the signature or an item of information does not correspond, the vote of the person must be challenged, and the same procedure must be followed as provided in this act for the challenging of an elector. If the elector does not have identification for election purposes as required under this section, the individual shall sign an affidavit to that effect before an election inspector and be allowed to vote as otherwise provided in this act. However, an elector being allowed to vote without identification for election purposes as required under this section is subject to challenge as provided in section 727. (3) If, upon a comparison of the signature or other identification as required in this section, it is found that the applicant is entitled to vote, the election officer having charge of the registration list shall approve the application and write his or her initials on the application, after which the number on the ballot issued must be noted on the application. The application serves as 1 of the 2 poll lists required to be kept as a record of a person who has voted. The application must be filed with the township, city, or village clerk. If voter registration cards are used in the precinct, the date of the election must be noted by 1 of the election officials upon the precinct registration card of each elector voting at an election. If voter registration lists are used in the precinct, the election official shall clearly indicate upon the list each elector voting at that election. The clerk of a city, village, or township shall maintain a record of voting participation for each registered elector. Sec. 523a. (1) If an individual who has applied to register to vote on or before the close of registration appears at a polling place on election day and completes an application under section 523 is not listed on the voter registration list, the election inspector shall issue a ballot to the individual as follows: (a) For an individual who presents a receipt issued by a department of state office, a designated voter registration agency, or the elector’s county, city, or township clerk’s office verifying the acceptance of a voter registration application before the close of registration and completes a new voter registration application, the election inspector shall allow the individual to vote a ballot in the same manner as an elector whose name is listed on the voter registration list. (b) For an individual who does not present a receipt verifying the acceptance of a voter registration application under subdivision (a), the election inspector shall determine whether the individual is in the appropriate polling place based on residence information provided by the individual. The election inspector shall review any documents or maps in the polling place or communicate with the city or township clerk to verify the appropriate polling place for the individual. The election inspector shall direct an individual who is not in the appropriate polling place to the appropriate polling place. If the individual refuses to go to the appropriate polling place, the election inspector shall issue the individual a provisional ballot that is processed according to subsection (5). (2) Except for an individual who produces a receipt under subsection (1)(a), the election inspector shall require an individual who is not listed on the voter registration list to execute a sworn statement affirming that the individual submitted a voter registration application before the close of registration and is eligible to vote in the election. An individual who provides false information in a signed sworn statement under this subsection is guilty of perjury. An individual signing a sworn statement shall complete a new voter registration application. The individual shall state the approximate date and in what manner the registration application was submitted: (a) To a department of state office. (b) To a designated voter registration agency. (c) To the office of his or her county, city, or township clerk. (d) By a mailed application. (3) The election inspector shall contact the city or township clerk to verify whether the individual who signed the sworn statement under subsection (2) is listed in the registration records of the jurisdiction or whether there is any information contrary to the content of the sworn statement. (4) If the city or township clerk verifies the elector information and finds no information contrary to the information provided by the individual in the sworn statement and the individual presents identification for election purposes that contains a current residence address to establish his or her identity and residence address, the individual is permitted to vote a provisional ballot that is tabulated on election day in the same manner as an elector whose name is listed on the voter registration list, except that the election inspectors shall process the ballot as a challenged ballot under sections 745 and 746. (5) If the election inspector is not able to contact the city or township clerk, the individual is not in the correct precinct, or the individual is unable to present identification for election purposes that contains a current residence address, the individual must be issued a provisional ballot that is not tabulated on election day but is secured for verification after the election. A provisional ballot must also be issued under this subsection to a voter who presents identification for election purposes that does not bear the voter’s current residence address, if the voter also presents a document to establish the voter’s current residence address. The election inspector shall accept a document containing the name and current residence address of the voter as sufficient documentation to issue a provisional ballot if it is 1 of the following documents: (a) A current utility bill. (b) A current bank statement. (c) A current paycheck, government check, or other government document. (6) A provisional ballot must be placed in a provisional ballot return envelope prescribed by the secretary of state and delivered to the city or township clerk after the polls close in a manner as prescribed by the secretary of state. (7) For a provisional ballot voted under subsection (4), the election inspector shall provide the voter with a notice that his or her ballot has been tabulated. For a provisional ballot voted under subsection (5), the election inspector shall provide the voter with a notice that the voter’s information will be verified by the clerk of the jurisdiction within 6 days after the election to determine whether the ballot will be tabulated and, if the ballot is not tabulated, to determine the reason it was not tabulated. A clerk of a jurisdiction shall provide a free access system for the voter to determine whether the ballot was tabulated. The free access system may include a telephone number that does not require a toll charge, a toll-free telephone number, an internet website, or a mailed notice. (8) As used in this section and sections 813 and 829, “provisional ballot” means a special ballot utilized for an individual who is not listed on the voter registration list at the polling place that is tabulated only after verification of the individual’s eligibility to vote. Sec. 761. (1) If the clerk of a city, township, or village receives an application for an absent voter ballot from a person registered to vote in that city, township, or village and if the signature on the application agrees with the signature for the person contained in the qualified voter file or on the registration card as required in subsection (2), the clerk immediately upon receipt of the application or, if the application is received before the printing of the absent voter ballots, as soon as the ballots are received by the clerk, shall forward by mail, postage prepaid, or shall deliver personally 1 of the ballots or set of ballots if there is more than 1 kind of ballot to be voted to the applicant. Subject to the identification requirement in subsection (6), absent voter ballots may be delivered to an applicant in person at the office of the clerk. (2) The qualified voter file must be used to determine the genuineness of a signature on an application for an absent voter ballot. Signature comparisons must be made with the digitized signature in the qualified voter file. If the qualified voter file does not contain a digitized signature of an elector, or is not accessible to the clerk, the city or township clerk shall compare the signature appearing on the application for an absent voter ballot to the signature contained on the master card. (3) Notwithstanding section 759, providing that no absent voter applications shall be received by the clerk after 2 p.m. on the Saturday before the election, and subject to the identification requirement in subsection (6), a person qualified to vote as an absent voter may apply in person at the clerk’s office before 4 p.m. on a day before the election except Sunday or a legal holiday to vote as an absent voter. The applicant shall receive his or her absent voter ballot and vote the ballot in the clerk’s office. All other absent voter ballots, except ballots delivered pursuant to an emergency absent voter ballot application under section 759b, must be mailed or delivered to the registration address of the applicant unless the application requests delivery to an address outside the city, village, or township or to a hospital or similar institution, in which case the absent voter ballots must be mailed or delivered to the address given in the application. However, a clerk may mail or deliver an absent voter ballot, upon request of the absent voter, to a post office box if the post office box is where the absent voter normally receives personal mail and the absent voter does not receive mail at his or her registration address. (4) Absent voter ballots must be issued in the same order in which applications are received by the clerk of a city, township, or village, as nearly as may be, and each ballot issued must bear the lowest number of each kind available for this purpose. However, this provision does not prohibit a clerk from immediately issuing an absent voter ballot to an absent voter who applies in person in the clerk’s office for absent voter ballots. The clerk shall enclose with the ballot or ballots a return envelope properly addressed to the clerk and bearing upon the back of the envelope a printed statement in substantially the following form: TO BE COMPLETED  BY THE CLERK –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––	–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 	Name of Voter	Street Address or R.R. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––	–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 	City, Township or Village	County Ward –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 	Precinct	 ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 	Date of Election  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– ========================================================================================  TO BE COMPLETED BY THE ABSENT VOTER I assert that I am a United States citizen and a qualified and registered elector of the city, township, or village named above.

ANY OTHER PERSON IN POSSESSION OF AN ABSENT VOTER BALLOT IS GUILTY OF A FELONY. (5) An absent voter who knowingly makes a false statement on the absent voter ballot return envelope is guilty of a misdemeanor. A person who assists an absent voter and who knowingly makes a false statement on the absent voter ballot return envelope is guilty of a felony. (6) If an elector obtains his or her absent voter ballot in person from the clerk of the city, township, or village in which he or she is registered, the clerk of the city, township, or village shall not provide an absent voter ballot to that elector until the elector identifies himself or herself to the clerk by presenting identification for election purposes. If an elector does not have identification for election purposes, the elector may sign an affidavit to that effect before the clerk of the city, township, or village and be allowed to obtain his or her absent voter ballot in person from the clerk. The clerk of the city, village, or township shall indicate to each elector who is registered in that city, village, or township and who obtains his or her absent voter ballot in person from the clerk that the elector may sign an affidavit indicating that the elector does not have identification for election purposes in order to obtain his or her absent voter ballot in person from the clerk. However, if an elector obtains his or her absent voter ballot in person from the clerk and votes by absent voter ballot without providing identification for election purposes required under this subsection, the absent voter ballot of that elector must be prepared as a challenged ballot as provided in section 727 and must be counted as any other ballot is counted unless determined otherwise by a court of law under section 747 or 748 or any other applicable law. Sec. 813. (1) Within 6 days after an election, for each provisional ballot that was placed in a provisional ballot return envelope, the city or township clerk shall determine whether the individual voting the provisional ballot was eligible to vote a ballot and whether to tabulate the provisional ballot. In making this determination, the city or township clerk shall not open the provisional ballot return envelope. A provisional ballot must only be tabulated if a valid voter registration record for the elector is located or if the identity and residence of the elector is established using identification for election purposes, along with a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, government check, or other government document to establish the voter’s current residence address if the identification for election purposes used by the elector does not contain the voter’s current residence address. Before the provisional ballot is tabulated, election officials shall process the ballot as a challenged ballot under sections 745 and 746. (2) Within 7 days after an election, but sooner if practicable, the city or township clerk shall transmit the results of provisional ballots tabulated after the election to the board of county canvassers. The results must be transmitted in a form prescribed by the secretary of state. (3) Within 7 days after an election, the city or township clerk shall transmit to the county clerk a provisional ballot report for each precinct in the jurisdiction. The report must include for each precinct the number of provisional ballots issued, the number of provisional ballots tabulated on election day, the number of provisional ballots forwarded to the clerk to be determined after the election, the number of provisional ballots tabulated by the clerk after election day, and any additional information concerning provisional ballots as required by the secretary of state. (4) Within 7 days after an election, the city or township clerk shall transmit to the county clerk an affidavit report that includes the number of affidavits signed by voters under section 523(2). The affidavit report must be transmitted to the county clerk in a form prescribed by the secretary of state. This act is ordered to take immediate effect.

the media conveys a materially inaccurate depiction of the individual's speech, appearance, or conduct as recorded in the unaltered recording; and
a reasonable person would be unable to recognize that the recording has been altered.
Media in which an artificially generated audio or visual imitation of an individual that:
has been created without the individual's consent; and
is sufficiently lifelike that a reasonable person would be unable to distinguish the speech or appearance of the imitation from the speech or appearance of the individual;
is used to convey a fictional depiction of the individual's speech, appearance, or conduct.
Media depicting the speech, appearance, or conduct of an artificially generated person, the appearance or speech of which is not a recognizable imitation of an identifiable individual.
Sec. 4. As used in this chapter, ""media"" means:
recorded audio;
a recorded image; or

Sec. 5. If a campaign communication includes fabricated media depicting a candidate, the person that paid for the campaign communication must include a disclaimer, separate from the disclaimer required under IC 3-9-3-2.5(d), that meets the following requirements:
The disclaimer must state: ""Elements of this media have been digitally altered or artificially generated."".

If the campaign communication is a printed communication, the disclaimer must be printed in a manner that complies with IC 3-9-3-2.5(e).
If the campaign communication is an audio communication, the disclaimer must be read:

displayed continuously for the duration of the campaign communication.
Sec. 6. (a) A candidate depicted in fabricated media that is included in a campaign communication that does not include a disclaimer required by section 5 of this chapter may bring a civil action against:
the person that paid for the campaign communication;
the person that sponsored the campaign communication; and
a person that disseminates the campaign communication, if:
the campaign communication included the disclaimer when provided to the person; and
the person knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly altered or removed the disclaimer before disseminating the campaign communication.
A plaintiff who prevails in an action brought under subsection (a) is entitled to recover:
the plaintiff's actual damages;
injunctive relief; and
the amount of any court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiff in connection with the action.

    22  leaders shall be elected at primary elections as herein provided, within
    23  every county in such city for each assembly district, or for  each  part
    24  of  an assembly district within such county as may be designated for the
    25  purpose in the rules of the county committee, and in every county of the
    26  state outside of such city where the rules so provide, for such assembly
    27  district or part thereof within such county as may be designated in such
    28  rules for the purpose. Such assembly district leaders or  such  assembly
    29  district  leader  and  associate  assembly  district  leader shall be of
    30  [ ]  different genders , if the rules of the county committee
    31  shall so provide, and shall be enrolled voters  of  the  party  residing
    32  within  the  assembly district and, if the rules of the county committee

    35  election and for the same term as members of the county committee.  When
    36  any  such rule provides for [ ] representation [ ]  by gender ,
    37  the designating petitions and primary ballots shall list candidates  for
    38  such  party  positions separately by [ ]  gender marker. In providing 
    39   for such representation, the county committee shall establish rules that 
    40   provide for the ability of individuals who do not  exclusively  identify 
    41   as  a  binary gender to serve as district leader and which respect indi- 
    42   viduals' gender identity . Each shall perform  such  duties,  powers  and
    43  functions as the rules of the county committee may prescribe.  Vacancies
    44  in such positions shall be filled by the members of the county committee
    45  within  the assembly district or part thereof, as the case may be, until
    46  the first primary election following the creation  of  such  vacancy  or
    47  vacancies  for  which  the  period for circulating designating petitions
    48  ends at least seven days after the creation of such  vacancy  or  vacan-
    49  cies,  at  which  time  the  successor  or  successors shall be directly
    50  elected as herein provided.  Assembly  district  leaders  and  associate
    51  assembly  district leaders shall automatically be members and shall have
    52  the right to participate and vote in meetings of the county committee or
    53  any subcommittee thereof. The county committee may provide by its  rules
    54  that  the members of the state committee, elected in accordance with the
    55  provisions of this chapter, shall possess the duties, powers  and  func-
    56  tions  of  an assembly district leader or an associate assembly district

     2  the  members  of  the state committee but upon [ ]  their  election as a
     3  member of the state committee, such person shall be deemed to have  also
     4  been  elected  as  an  assembly district leader or an associate assembly
     5  district leader.

    13  elected by the state committee or by a state convention of the party, as
    14  the  rules  of  the  state  committee shall prescribe. If the rules of a
    15  national party provide for [ ]  representation  [ ]   by 
    16   gender   among  delegates elected from districts, such district delegates
    17  shall be elected separately by [ ]  gender .    District  delegates  and
    18  alternates  to national party conventions and delegates, and alternates,
    19  if any, to such a state convention shall be elected at  a  primary.  All
    20  delegates  and  alternates  to  a  national  party  convention  shall be
    21  enrolled members of such party. When any such rule provides for  [ ]
    22  representation  [ ]  by gender , the designating petitions and
    23  primary ballots shall list candidates for such party positions separate-
    24  ly by [ ]  gender marker. In providing  for  such  representation,  the 
    25   party  shall establish rules that provide for the ability of individuals 
    26   who do not exclusively identify as a binary gender to serve as delegates 
    27   and which respect individuals' gender identity .

    34  contains next to each voter's name at least the  following  information:
    35  address,  town  or  city,  assembly district where appropriate, election
    36  district, registration serial number, party enrollment, date  of  regis-
    37  tration,  [ ]   gender ,  date of birth and, if the voter is in inactive
    38  status, an indication of that fact.
    39    § 6. Subdivision 7 of section 7-116 of the election law, as  added  by
    40  chapter 173 of the laws of 2017, is amended to read as follows:
    41    7.  Whenever  a county board of elections or the board of elections in
    42  the city of New York must conduct a primary election in  the  respective
    43  county or the city of New York in which separate contests for [ 
    44   ] candidates  of different genders  for the same party position
    45  are to be printed upon the ballots,  and when rules require  these  posi- 
    46   tions be listed separately on the ballot,  the respective county board of
    47  elections or the board of elections in the city of New York shall deter-

     5   for  positions  elected  in gendered contests which respect the individ- 
     6   uals' gender identity.  In no case shall the board of elections  promul- 
     7   gate rules that are inconsistent with a system that requires individuals 
     8   filing  for  candidacy to self-identify their gender marker as ""M"", ""F"", 
     9   or ""X"", requires all candidates to run in a single race,  and  maintains 
    10   requirements for gender diversity.
